## ByNameModding
ByNameModding is a library for modding il2cpp games by classes, methods, field names on Android. It includes everything you need for modding unity games.

## Getting Started
+ First clone the repo and add it to your project.
+ Add [BNM.cpp](ByNameModding/BNM.cpp) to Android.mk or CMakeLists.txt.<br>
    Android.mk
    ```mk
    LOCAL_SRC_FILES += ByNameModding/BNM.cpp
    ```
    CMakeLists.txt
    ```cmake
    add_library("Your lib name" SHARED ByNameModding/BNM.cpp "...other cpp files")
    ```
+ Change `UNITY_VER`, include your string obfuscator and hooking software, uncomment `BNM_DOTNET35` if the game uses .NET 3.5 in [BNM_settings.hpp](ByNameModding/BNM_settings.hpp)
+ Done! See [Examples.cpp](Examples.cpp) or add it to your project to understand how to work with BNM.
